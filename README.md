<!-- project philosophy -->
<img src="./readme/title2.svg"/>

> A mobile app that takes live data from a running tracker, then plays music with a BPM (Beats Per Minute) matching the runner's pace.
>
> Cadence revolutionizes your runs by integrating live data from your tracker with dynamic music playback. Our app ensures that every stride is perfectly synced with the rhythm, enhancing motivation and performancence. 

### User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to listen to music according to my pace, so that the music matches my rhythm without having to take care of it manually.
- As a user, I want to customize my music playlist based on my planned pace, so I can manage my energy and performance during different stages of my run.
- As a user, I want to create multiple custom playlists, each tailored to different running scenarios, so I can follow my running plan through playlists.

###  Cadence is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the [Flutter app development framework](https://flutter.dev/). Flutter is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [Hive](https://hivedb.dev/) package which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local database.
- To send local push notifications, the app uses the [flutter_local_notifications](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_local_notifications) package which supports Android, iOS, and macOS.
- The app uses the font ["Urbanist"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Urbanist?stroke=Sans+Serif&subset=latin&noto.script=Latn) as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.
